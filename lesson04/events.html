        <!--To troubleshoot this project alone I had to use several troubleshooting methods. 
        I used breakpoints after entering break mode to determine why I was ghetting the same alert twice when hitting submit. 
        I used bulletproofing in the form of if statements to make sure that empty fields were not entered rendering the gathered information useless.
        I use a call stack in the form of the myJava.js file to execute my Javascript code.
        I use a catch statement to catch any unhandled errors not caught by my bulletproofing.
        I used commenting out to make sure that the catch statement was not causing an issue with thje exectuion of my code.
        I had an issue with dependencies whe I realized that I mistakenly called a funtion both when receiving a Submit action as well as on form load.
        I used built in linting within Brackets when I was writing the code. Mostly having to do with compairisons using the === operator.
        I fixed a logic error that made a call to a field ID that didn't exist thus telling me that the programming could not execute when compairing to a null value.
        I encapsulated my bulletproofing within a try statement to catch any unforseen errors.-->
