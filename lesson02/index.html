            <h2>About Japan</h2>
            <p>
                Japan is an amazing country with a rich culture and history. It is one of the largest producers in the world of cars, music, games, literature, and media. With the infrastructure of the country in ruins after World War 2 they have rebuilt to be one of the most modern and efficient technology hubs around the globe. On the flip side they have amazing historical sites that have been preserved in pristine condition. We'll go over a bit of both the new and old sides of Japan throughout the other pages of this site.
